  ...

  - implement ability to highlight members with different colors

  - implement ability to change profile direction of member icons

  - fix positioning within members panel when in names view

---Figure out implementation details---
  - determining shortest distance traffic routes for each member icon
  - displaying traffic routes
  - traffic animation that prevents member icons from going through each other
  - traffic animation between formations (dancers coming onto stage from left/right offstage)
  - suggestions or templates for formations (based on number of members desired)
  - way to share blocking & notes with dancers
  - option to turn off 'snapping to grid' for selected groups of member icons
  - different traveling animation speed for different member icons (should this be automatic)
  - pairing formation changes with music
  - social-media-like platform to view friends' formations
  - adding dimensions of stages
