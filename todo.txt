  ...

  [styling]
  - shadows: nav bar, two side panels, main canvas, member icons, toast
     - fix shadow for add formation button
  - give main canvas more surrounding white space if add shadows, make scrollbar bigger & give more distance
  - put a bit of space at top and bottom of scroll bar

  - prevent member icons from being dropped on other icons
  - ability to add new formation after currently selected formation
  - ability to move formations

  - implement multi-select (with shift too)
  - implement ability to change profile direction of member icons
  - suggestions or templates for formations (based on number of members desired)
  - option to turn off 'snapping to grid' for selected groups of member icons

  - responsiveness
  - web browser dependencies

---Figure out implementation details---
  - determining shortest distance traffic routes for each member icon
  - displaying traffic routes
  - traffic animation that prevents member icons from going through each other
  - traffic animation between formations (dancers coming onto stage from left/right offstage)
  - way to share blocking & notes with dancers
  - different traveling animation speed for different member icons (should this be automatic)
  - pairing formation changes with music
  - social-media-like platform to view friends' formations
  - adding dimensions of stages
  - implement ability to highlight members with different colors

---See if users would want / need---
- copy previous placement of member icons when adding new formation
