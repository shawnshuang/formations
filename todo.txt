---To Do---
  - move toggle button
  - add formation button: click animation
  - toggle button: styling, hover animation, click animation

  - bug: when only one formation left, need to click delete twice

  - prevent member icons from being dropped on other icons

  - undoing formation delete
 
  - ability to add new formation after currently selected formation
  - ability to move formations

  - implement multi-select (with shift too)

  - responsiveness
  - web browser dependencies

  - finish reading Hartl's RoR Tutorial
  - figure out user interaction for adding new members (watch out for length of name)
  - make members panel scrollable

  ...

  - implement ability to change profile direction of member icons
  - suggestions or templates for formations (based on number of members desired)
  - option to turn off 'snapping to grid' for selected groups of member icons

  ...

  [styling]
  - shadows: nav bar, two side panels, main canvas, member icons
  - spacing: give filmstrip more width, give main canvas more surrounding white space, make scrollbar bigger & give more distance

  - fix positioning within members panel when in names view

---Figure out implementation details---
  - determining shortest distance traffic routes for each member icon
  - displaying traffic routes
  - traffic animation that prevents member icons from going through each other
  - traffic animation between formations (dancers coming onto stage from left/right offstage)
  - way to share blocking & notes with dancers
  - different traveling animation speed for different member icons (should this be automatic)
  - pairing formation changes with music
  - social-media-like platform to view friends' formations
  - adding dimensions of stages
  - implement ability to highlight members with different colors

---See if users would want / need---
- copy previous placement of member icons when adding new formation
- implement animation for deleting formation
